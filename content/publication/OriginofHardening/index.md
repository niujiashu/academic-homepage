abstract: Many experiments have confirmed the spectral hardening in a few hundred GV of cosmic ray (CR) nuclei spectra, and 3 different origins have been proposed':' the primary source acceleration, the propagation, and the superposition of different kinds of sources. In this work, the break power law has been employed to fit each of the AMS-02 nuclei spectra directly when the rigidity greater than 45 GV. The fitting results of the break rigidity and the spectral index differences less and greater than the break rigidity show complicated relationships among different nuclei species, which could not been reproduced naturally by a simple primary source scenario or a propagation scenario. However, with a natural and simple assumption, the superposition of different kinds of sources could have the potential to explain the fitting results successfully. CR nuclei spectra from one single experiment in future (such as DAMPE) will provide us the opportunity to do cross checks and reveal the properties of the different kinds of sources.
