abstract: Many experiments have confirmed the spectral hardening at a few hundred GV of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei spectra, and 3 general different origins have been proposed':' the primary source acceleration, the propagation, and the superposition of different kinds of sources. Here we report some new findings from the AMS-02 nuclei spectra of B and its dominating parents species (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, and Si)':' the nuclei spectral hardening in a few hundred GV should have hybrid origins. Besides the propagation origin, the superposition of different kinds of sources are also needed for different kinds of the CR primary nuclei species. All these results can be further confirmed by more precise CR nuclei spectra data in high rigidity regions (like that from DAMPE), and could provide us an opportunity to improve the current CR models.
